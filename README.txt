1: Getting the modpack running
	1.1: Forge
		First off you need to install Forge version 2555 for Minecraft version 1.12.2
		There's plenty of existing guides for this.
		All mods go into the mods folder in your .minecraft root folder.


	1.2: Required mods
		These mods are required to be able to join the server.
		The corresponding file will have links to the download pages for all mods.
		Why I'm not simply reuploading is answered in the FAQ section below (3.1).
		
		Always make sure to download the correct version.
		For example on CurseForge you'll see 2 download buttons.
		The green one is the latest version and the gray one is the version you are looking at, but the latest version isn't always the version used on the server.
		tldr: always use the gray button on curseforge.
		On 9minecraft make sure to always pick the version mentioned between brackets after the url.


	1.3: Recommended mods
		These are mods recommended but not required to join the server.
		They range from usefull tools like Inventory Tweaks and VoxelMap, to mods that make the game feel better, but don't change any base functionality like Sound Filters and Dynamic Environments.


	1.4: Miscellaneous
		These are mods I don't exactly recommend, but will be using myself.
		These only make changes to the feeling of Minecraft.


	1.5: Litemods
		Some of these mods, like Voxelmap (recommended) and Mine Little Pony (miscellaneous) are mods that use LiteLoader.
		There's different ways to install LiteLoader but I would recommend extracting the jar and putting it in the mods folder.
		This results in it being loaded as a mod which also loads all litemods in the mods folder.
		These mods will have (LiteMod) after their name in the 3 files.
		Download the installer from here: http://www.liteloader.com/download#snapshot_11220
		After you did that run the installer and EXTRACT liteloader to the mods folder.


2: Joining the server
	To join the server you first must be at least know who Dunpield is and be part of his Discord server.
	You can let me know your ign on there and I'll add you to the whitelist.
	After that you'll be able to join the Dunpire at this ip address: 94.111.111.26


3: FAQ
	3.1: Why links instead of actual mod files?
		Some mod authors have specific rules against reuploading mods, even in modpack format.
		By using this method we won't be breaking any rules and we can still play together using the same modpack.
